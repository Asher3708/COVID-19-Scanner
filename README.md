## Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) X-Ray Scanner 
I built a CNN neural network that classifies a given Chest X-ray as positive for pneumonia caused by COVID-19 or not. This model is originally meant to demonstrate a proof-of-concept. The model was trained, and accepts, Posteroanterior views only. 


## Resources
Updated Model (Use with Pytorch; .pth) : https://www.dropbox.com/s/hovi7vc0edv8fxt/corona_V2.pth?dl=0 <br/>

Primary Dataset used: https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset <br/>

Secondary Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia <br/>

Test_results: check the csv file in the repository <br/>

## Roadmap

1. Train model in different Architectures and with Pneumonia labels. (May 2020)
2. Get more Data. (May 2020 onwards)
