## Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) X-Ray Scanner 
I built a CNN neural network that classifies a given Chest X-ray as positive for pneumonia caused by COVID-19 or not. This model is originally meant to demonstrate a proof-of-concept. The model was trained, and accepts, Posteroanterior views only.
