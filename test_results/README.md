## Results on Test Set

Consists of the following:

1. 1000 images taken randomly from the RSNA dataset (*RSNA_results.csv*) and reserved to be the test set.
2. 10 images taken from the [British Society of Thoracic Imaging COVID-19 Database](https://www.bsti.org.uk/training-and-education/covid-19-bsti-imaging-database/). (*Covid_positive_results.csv*)

### Miscellaneous

The training metadata (*Covid_training_metadata.csv*) lists the COVID-19 positive images used for training. It is evidence that the test set and the training set did not overlap

## Limitations

Due to the current lack of publicly-accessible COVID-19 images, only a small test set for True COVID-19 images can be assembled.
